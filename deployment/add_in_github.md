Great! You can push your project (with both backend and frontend) to GitHub by following these steps.

---

### ✅ Step-by-step Guide to Push Your Project to GitHub

#### 📁 1. Go to Your Project Directory

Open a terminal and `cd` into your project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/personal-finance-management-application
```

---

#### 🆕 2. Initialize a Git Repository (if not already initialized)

```bash
git init
```

---

#### 📄 3. Add Files to Git

```bash
git add .
```

This stages all files (backend + frontend).

---

#### 📝 4. Commit the Files

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

#### 🌐 5. Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2. Click on **"New"** or the "+" icon → **New repository**.
3. Name your repo (e.g., `personal-finance-management-app`).
4. Leave **"Initialize with README"** unchecked (since you already committed locally).
5. Click **Create repository**.

---

#### 🔗 6. Connect Local Repo to GitHub Repo

GitHub will give you this line after creating the repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-management-app.git
```

Run that in your terminal.

---

#### 📤 7. Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main  # Rename your local branch to 'main'
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ✅ Done!

Your full project with both backend and frontend is now pushed to GitHub.

---

### 🔄 Optional: Add `.gitignore` Before Pushing

Create a `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing unnecessary files (like `node_modules`, `.env`, etc.). Example:

```
# Node modules
node_modules/

# Environment files
.env

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# Build
dist/
build/
```
