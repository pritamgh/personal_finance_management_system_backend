## VPC and Subnets Primer:

- VPC: Private network to deploy resources

- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC

- A Public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet

- A Public subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet

- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route tables
