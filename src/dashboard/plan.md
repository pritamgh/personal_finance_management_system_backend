Yes, **you should definitely consider adding a Dashboard page** to your Personal Finance Management application â€” it's not just a "nice-to-have," it can be a **core part of the user experience**. Here's why:

### âœ… **Why You Need a Dashboard Page**

#### 1. **Quick Overview / Snapshot**

- Users typically want a **high-level summary** when they open a finance app â€” not to dig through each module.
- A dashboard provides a **centralized place** to see:

  - Total income vs. expenses
  - Current budget status
  - Recent transactions
  - Financial goals progress
  - Alerts (e.g. overspending)

#### 2. **Improves UX and Flow**

- It becomes the **natural landing/home page** of your app.
- Users get oriented right away and can **navigate quickly** to modules like Transactions or Reports based on what catches their eye.

#### 3. **Highlight Trends and Warnings**

- You can show visual trends (charts/graphs) or even alerts like:

  - "You're 85% through your monthly budget."
  - "Your average daily expense is rising this week."

#### 4. **Makes the App Feel Complete**

- Most successful finance apps (e.g., Mint, YNAB, PocketGuard) have a dashboard.
- It makes your app feel more polished, professional, and user-friendly.

### âœ… When NOT to Add a Dashboard?

Only consider skipping it if:

- Your app is **extremely minimalist**, and each module is already a dashboard-style view.
- Your target audience prefers function over form (e.g. accountants, spreadsheet-lovers).

But in 99% of cases, **adding a dashboard will improve usability and user satisfaction**.
